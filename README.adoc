:toc: left

Plugin for https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant] (jQA), a tool suite to analyze arbitrary software structures (Java and other source code, dependencies, Git repositories, and many more).
Enables to scan https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible] repositories for further analysis and reporting.

Based on

* the great https://101.jqassistant.org/implementation-of-a-scanner-plugin/[101 Tutorial to write a jQAssistant Plugins],
* the nice https://gitlab.com/ilpianista/ansible-inventory-java/[Ansible Inventory Java] package.

[CAUTION]
====
The plugin is currently only a starting point to scan Ansible repositories for jQA.
In fact, it only allows to scan Ansible local inventories to jQA.
Scanning of Ansible roles, playbooks etc. is currently left to an extended version of the https://github.com/jQAssistant/jqa-yaml2-plugin/[jQA YAML2 Plugin].

Analysis of and reasoning about the Ansible repository is (yet) completely open.

_Therefore, the plugin has a 0-version until it's first official release.
Expect changes in the API and implementation without prior notice._

== Getting started

=== Build / Install

First versions are available via

[source, xml]
include::pom.xml[tags=sonatype-url]

as SNAPSHOT

[source, xml]
include::pom.xml[tags=sonatype-snapshot-repo]

Additionally it is possible to build it locally:

* Clone and build https://github.com/ascheman/ansible-inventory-java/[Ansible Inventory Java] as pre-requisite:
** `git clone https://github.com/ascheman/ansible-inventory-java`
** `(cd ansible-inventory-java && ./mvnw clean install)`
* Clone and build the plugin itself
** `git clone https://github.com/ascheman/jqa-ansible-plugin`
** `(cd jqa-ansible-plugin && ./mvnw clean install)`

=== Usage

Use in your Ansible project as any other jQA plugin, e.g.,

[source, xml]
.pom.xml (part)
----
...
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.buschmais.jqassistant</groupId>
                <artifactId>jqassistant-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.10-SNAPSHOT</version>
...
                <dependencies>
...
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>net.aschemann.jqassistant.plugins</groupId>
                        <artifactId>jqa-ansible-plugin</artifactId>
                        <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                    </dependency>
                </dependencies>
            </plugin>

It will detect your Ansible inventories (and the included hosts, groups, variables, and subgroups) and add them to Neo4j database.
